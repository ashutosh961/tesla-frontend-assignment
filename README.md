# How to install the dependencies on the project

Clone the repository and type "npm install" in the terminal.
A node_modules folder will be created for all the required dependencies

# How to start the project
Type "npm start" to start the localhost server on port 3000

# Copy and paste the localhost URL in the browser
  The url is "http://localhost:3000/"

# Layout of the UI

*)You will see 4 counters for adding the batteries. For each batch of 4 batteries, a transformer will be added. 
*)If you press the calculate button, then the required landsize, cost and energy demands will be calculated.
*)When you add a new battery to the grid, the landscape below the calculate button will show a new grid of a specific size and it is depicted by the battery name
*)You can only add batteries which fit the total grid size. The total grid size is constant which is 400 px * 400 px.
*)The battery sizes are scaled down to fit in the above mentioned grid dimensions.
*) If you try to add batteries which exceed the total grid area, you ll get a modal stating that you cannot add any more batteries.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
